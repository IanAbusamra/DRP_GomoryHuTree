# Gomory-Hu Tree: Implementation of Gomory-Hu Tree for Directed Reading Program

This is a computer program in C++ that takes an undirected weighted graph as input and constructs and returns a Gomory-Hu Tree. This project was for the **Spring 2025 Georgia Tech Directed Reading Program**.

To run (assuming g++ exists):

1. Type ``g++ -o main gomory_hu.h main.cpp` into Terminal.
2. Type ``./main`` into Terminal.
